# devtips
demo code for using 980f's cortexm development libraries

see the onclone.sh for fetching the repos that this repo uses.

Each demo project has cmake files and perhaps a Rowley CrossStudio project file. 

The CMakeLists.txt needs minor adjustment for each processor, perhaps someday I can pass the piece that differs via command line.

Actually .. I am going to create a branch for each chip instead of naming the files for the chip. That should allow for easy comparisons for differences.
